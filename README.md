## Overview

In this workshop you will create a skill called Pet Match that matches the user
with a pet. When launched, this Alexa Skill will prompt the user for the
information it needs to determine a match. Once all of the required information
is collected, it will send the data to an external web service which processes
the data and returns the match.

Through this workshop, you'll learn how to use advanced Alexa Skills Kit
features to create and configure an Alexa Skill and AWS Lambda. The features you'll
learn to use are Dialog Management and Entity Resolution. These features leverage
Alexa's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU),
and Machine Learning (ML), which makes your life easier because you don't have
to write code. You only need to provide training data to the Alexa engines via your
interaction model. The skill builder makes it easy to do so.
